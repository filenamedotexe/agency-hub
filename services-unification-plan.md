# Services Unification Plan: Consolidating Commerce Under One Roof

## Executive Summary

This plan consolidates the fragmented store/services/orders/analytics experience into a unified "Services" hub. By merging these related features, we eliminate confusion, reduce menu clutter, and create a world-class user experience where admins manage everything service-related in one place.

**Key Benefits:**

- Single source of truth for all service-related operations
- Role-based views showing relevant content to each user type
- Reduced cognitive load and context switching
- Clean, intuitive navigation

## Current State Analysis

### Navigation Structure

Currently, we have 4 separate menu items for related functionality:

```
├── Services (service template management)
├── Store (customer-facing shopping)
├── Orders (admin order management)
└── Sales Analytics (revenue reporting)
```

### Problems Identified

1. **Admin Confusion**: Clicking "Store" shows customer shopping view
2. **Fragmented Experience**: Related data scattered across 4 pages
3. **Context Switching**: Can't see orders while managing services
4. **Menu Clutter**: Too many similar menu items

### Data Model Understanding

- `ServiceTemplate` - The products being sold (with price, description, etc.)
- `Service` - Instance of a template assigned to a client
- `Order` - Purchase record with payment details
- `OrderItem` - Links orders to service templates

## Target Architecture

### Unified Navigation

```
├── Dashboard
├── Clients
├── Services ← Everything service-related lives here
├── Requests
├── Calendar
└── Settings
```

### Services Hub Structure

```
/services
  ├── (tabs based on user role)
  ├── Admin/Manager View:
  │   ├── Catalog (manage service templates)
  │   ├── Orders (all customer orders)
  │   └── Analytics (sales & revenue data)
  │
  └── Client View:
      ├── Browse (shop for services)
      ├── My Orders (order history)
      └── My Services (active services)
```

## Testing Requirements

### Playwright MCP Tool Integration

**MANDATORY**: Every phase must include comprehensive Playwright testing using the MCP tool. Phase completion is contingent on achieving 100% test success.

### Test Development Workflow

1. **Before Implementation**: Write Playwright tests for expected behavior
2. **During Implementation**: Run tests continuously to catch issues early
3. **After Implementation**: Full test suite must pass before phase sign-off

### Test Types Required

- **Unit Tests**: Individual component functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Component interactions and data flow
- **Visual Regression Tests**: Screenshot comparisons for UI consistency
- **Accessibility Tests**: WCAG compliance verification
- **Performance Tests**: Load time and responsiveness metrics

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Navigation & Routing Structure (2 hours + 1 hour testing)

#### 1.1 Update Navigation Menu

**File:** `src/components/layout/dashboard-layout.tsx`

**Changes:**

- Remove separate Store, Orders, Sales Analytics menu items
- Keep only Services menu item
- Update icon to represent full commerce (e.g., Package or ShoppingBag)

```typescript
// Remove lines 104-126 (Store, Order History, Orders, Sales Analytics)
// Update Services item (line 76-80) to:
{
  name: "Services",
  href: "/services",
  icon: Package, // Changed from current icon
  allowedRoles: ["ADMIN", "SERVICE_MANAGER", "CLIENT"],
}
```

#### 1.2 Create New Services Layout

**New File:** `src/app/(dashboard)/services/layout.tsx`

This layout will:

- Detect user role
- Show appropriate tabs
- Handle tab navigation

### Phase 2: Services Hub Page with Tabs (3 hours + 1 hour testing)

#### 2.1 Replace Current Services Page

**File:** `src/app/(dashboard)/services/page.tsx`

Transform from service template list to tabbed interface:

- Add tab navigation component
- Implement role-based tab visibility
- Set default tab based on role

#### 2.2 Create Tab Components

**New Files:**

```
src/app/(dashboard)/services/components/
  ├── catalog-tab.tsx (admin service management)
  ├── orders-tab.tsx (order management)
  ├── analytics-tab.tsx (sales analytics)
  ├── browse-tab.tsx (client shopping)
  ├── my-orders-tab.tsx (client orders)
  └── my-services-tab.tsx (client services)
```

### Phase 3: Move Existing Features (2 hours + 1 hour testing)

#### 3.1 Catalog Tab (Admin Service Management)

- Move current services page content to `catalog-tab.tsx`
- Enhance with table view option
- Add bulk operations (archive multiple, export)
- Include quick stats (total revenue per service)

#### 3.2 Orders Tab

- Import existing `/admin/orders` page component
- Integrate as tab content
- Maintain all current functionality

#### 3.3 Analytics Tab

- Import existing `/admin/sales` page component
- Integrate as tab content
- Maintain all current functionality

#### 3.4 Browse Tab (Client Shopping)

- Import existing `/store` page component
- Integrate as tab content
- Maintain shopping cart functionality

### Phase 4: Enhance Admin Catalog View (2 hours + 1 hour testing)

#### 4.1 Add View Toggle

- Grid view (current card layout)
- Table view for data-dense operations

#### 4.2 Enhanced Service Table

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ □ | Service | Price | Status | Orders | Revenue | Actions       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ □ | Web Design Pro | $1,200 | Active | 23 | $27,600 | ••• │
│ □ | Logo Design | $500 | Active | 45 | $22,500 | ••• │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### 4.3 Quick Actions

- Inline edit for price/status
- Duplicate service
- View service analytics
- Archive/Delete

### Phase 5: API & Route Updates (1 hour + 30 min testing)

#### 5.1 Update API Endpoints

No changes needed - existing APIs remain:

- `/api/service-templates`
- `/api/orders`
- `/api/analytics/*`

#### 5.2 Redirect Old Routes

Add redirects in `next.config.js`:

```javascript
{
  source: '/store',
  destination: '/services?tab=browse',
  permanent: true,
},
{
  source: '/admin/orders',
  destination: '/services?tab=orders',
  permanent: true,
},
{
  source: '/admin/sales',
  destination: '/services?tab=analytics',
  permanent: true,
}
```

### Phase 6: Mobile Optimization (1 hour + 1 hour testing)

#### 6.1 Mobile Tab Navigation

- Horizontal scrollable tabs
- Dropdown tab selector for many tabs
- Swipe gestures between tabs

#### 6.2 Responsive Enhancements

- Stack cards vertically on mobile
- Collapsible filters
- Touch-optimized actions

### Phase 7: Testing & Polish (2 hours)

#### 7.1 Mandatory Playwright MCP Tool Testing

**REQUIREMENT**: Each phase MUST achieve 100% success rate in Playwright testing before marking complete.

**Testing Scope:**

- **Code Error Testing**: All functionality must work without JavaScript errors
- **Visual Error Testing**: All UI elements must render correctly without layout issues
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Test on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
- **Responsive Testing**: Test on desktop (1920x1080), tablet (768x1024), and mobile (375x667)

**Test Categories:**

1. **Navigation Testing**

   - Menu item clicks work correctly
   - Tab switching functions smoothly
   - Role-based visibility is enforced
   - Redirects from old routes work

2. **Functional Testing**

   - All CRUD operations work (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
   - Form submissions process correctly
   - Data loads without errors
   - Pagination and filtering work

3. **Visual Testing**

   - No overlapping elements
   - Proper spacing and alignment
   - Responsive breakpoints work correctly
   - Loading states display properly
   - Empty states show when appropriate

4. **Error Handling**
   - Network failures handled gracefully
   - Invalid inputs show proper validation
   - 404 pages for invalid routes
   - Session timeouts handled properly

**Playwright Test Structure:**

```typescript
// tests/e2e/services-unification.spec.ts
test.describe("Services Unification - Phase Completion", () => {
  test.describe("Code Error Tests", () => {
    // No console errors
    // All API calls succeed
    // Forms submit without errors
  });

  test.describe("Visual Error Tests", () => {
    // Screenshot comparisons
    // Layout integrity checks
    // Responsive design validation
  });

  test.describe("Role-Based Access", () => {
    // Admin sees all tabs
    // Manager sees appropriate tabs
    // Client sees only their tabs
  });
});
```

#### 7.2 Test All User Roles

- Admin: All tabs visible and functional (verified by Playwright)
- Manager: Catalog, Orders, Analytics visible (verified by Playwright)
- Client: Browse, My Orders, My Services visible (verified by Playwright)

#### 7.3 Performance Optimization

- Lazy load tab content
- Maintain tab state during navigation
- Cache tab data appropriately
- Measure and ensure tab switching < 200ms
