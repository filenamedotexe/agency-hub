## API Endpoints Created

- `GET /api/clients` - List clients with pagination
- `POST /api/clients` - Create new client
- `GET /api/clients/[id]` - Get client by ID
- `PUT /api/clients/[id]` - Update client
- `DELETE /api/clients/[id]` - Delete client
- `GET /api/activity-logs` - Get activity logs

## Components Created

- `ClientList` - Main list view with search/filter
- `ClientForm` - Reusable form for create/edit
- `ActivityLogComponent` - Display activity timeline

## Pages Created

- `/clients` - Client list page
- `/clients/new` - Create client page
- `/clients/[id]` - Client detail page
- `/clients/[id]/edit` - Edit client page

## Responsive Design Features

- Mobile-first approach implemented
- Touch-friendly tap targets (44x44px minimum)
- Responsive table hides columns on small screens
- Form layouts adapt to screen size
- Navigation remains accessible on all devices

## Security & Best Practices

- All mutations require authentication
- Activity logging for audit trail
- Input validation on both client and server
- Error boundaries for graceful failures
- TypeScript for type safety throughout

## Testing Results

- ✅ All unit tests passing (client service and validation)
- ⚠️ E2E tests require authentication fix
- ✅ UI components implemented and styled correctly
- ✅ Responsive layout implemented (verified in code)
- ✅ Database schema and seed data working

## Known Issues

- Authentication flow in E2E tests needs troubleshooting
- The login form submits but doesn't navigate to dashboard
- This appears to be an integration issue between the auth service and Supabase

## Next Steps

Phase 3 will build upon this foundation to add:

- Service templates CRUD
- Service assignment to clients
- Task management within services
- Status workflows
- Client visibility toggles
