## Task Checklist Feature

### Overview

Tasks within service templates can now include internal checklists for tracking completion steps. These checklists are never visible to clients and are designed for internal team use only.

### Key Features

- **Internal Only**: Checklists are never shown to clients, maintaining clean client-facing task views
- **Smart Completion**: When all checklist items are completed, system prompts with toast notification asking if task should be marked as done
- **Template Integration**: Checklist items are defined in service templates and automatically copied to tasks when services are assigned to clients
- **Real-time Updates**: Checklist progress is updated instantly with visual feedback

### Usage Flow

1. **Template Creation**: Add checklist items to tasks in service templates
2. **Service Assignment**: Checklist items automatically copied to actual tasks
3. **Task Execution**: Team members check off items as they complete them
4. **Completion Prompt**: System suggests marking task as done when all items completed
5. **Client View**: Clients see clean task view without internal checklist details

## Dynamic Field Click-to-Copy Feature

### Overview

All dynamic fields (displayed in the format `{{fieldName}}`) throughout the application are now clickable and will copy the field to the clipboard when clicked. This provides a seamless user experience for working with dynamic fields across forms, content tools, and client data.

### Key Features

- **Universal Click-to-Copy**: Any dynamic field pattern `{{fieldName}}` displayed anywhere in the app is clickable
- **Visual Feedback**: Fields have hover states and copy cursor indicators
- **Toast Notifications**: Successful copy operations show confirmation toasts
- **Consistent Styling**: Three variants available: `inline`, `code`, and `badge` for different contexts
- **Auto-Detection**: The `DynamicText` component automatically detects and makes dynamic field patterns clickable in any text content

### Implementation

- **DynamicField Component**: Renders individual dynamic fields as clickable elements (`src/components/ui/dynamic-field.tsx`)
- **DynamicText Component**: Automatically processes text to make any `{{field}}` patterns clickable
- **Used Throughout**: Form responses, content tools, generated content, and field configuration areas

## Content Tools Enhanced Features

### Dynamic Field Integration

- **Client Data Fields**: Automatic integration of client name, business name, and address
- **Form Response Fields**: Dynamic fields from client form responses are automatically available
- **Smart Notifications**: Toast notifications inform users when clients have missing or partial dynamic field data
- **Organized Display**: Available dynamic fields are organized by category (Client Data, form-specific sections)

### Enhanced Generated Content Management

- **Client-Specific Filtering**: Generated content section dynamically updates based on client selection
- **Just Generated Section**: New content appears in a highlighted "Just Generated" section with green accent
- **Previous Generations**: Comprehensive history with metadata including client name, generation date, and prompt preview
- **Sorting Options**: Sort by date or client when viewing all content for a tool
- **Individual Actions**: Copy and download actions for each piece of generated content
- **Real-time Updates**: Content list refreshes automatically after new generations

### Improved UI/UX

- **Better Styling**: Clean, organized layouts with proper visual hierarchy

### Content Storage & Organization

- **Database Storage**: All generated content is properly stored in the `generated_content` table
- **Metadata Tracking**: Comprehensive metadata including variables used, timestamps, and generation context
- **Client Association**: Content is properly linked to specific clients for easy retrieval
- **Tool Association**: Content is organized by the specific content tool used

## Webhook Testing & Environment Management

### Test Webhook Functionality
